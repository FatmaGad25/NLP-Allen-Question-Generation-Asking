0,What is the principle of inclusions and components?," or clasts are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is",the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them,"The principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions or clasts are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them."
1,What is the relationship between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of?,"olid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convect",intimate coupling,"There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantleoceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle."
2,What is the meaning of convergent boundaries?,"earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts under another. Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas fault syste",one plate subducts under another,"Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts under another."
3,What are the long linear regions of geologic features?,"th. Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries. Midocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal ",plate boundaries,Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries.
4,What is the principle of faunal succession?,ins them. The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist at the same time period th,based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks,The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks.
5,What is the difference between xenoliths and sedimentary rocks?,"later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them. The principle of faunal succession is based on the ap",older than the rock which contains them,"As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them."
6,What is the role of plate tectonics in the evolution of the Earth?,f the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics. Th,coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle,"Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegeners theory of continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time."
7,What is the most important reason for expanding the fourth scale?,"ecent era is expanded in the third scale. Since the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs, it is further expanded in the fourth scale. T",the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs,"The Holocene the latest epoch is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right, another reason for expanding the fourth scale."
8,What is the power of the theory of plate tectonics?,nics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle. Seismologi,its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle,The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.
9,What is the meaning of succession?,iths are older than the rock which contains them. The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As or,faunal succession,"Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwins theory of evolution, the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought."
